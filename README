Developer NOTEs
*) Creation of Objects can be done only by ObjectTemplateManager::createObject().

*) During Object creation neither Object nor its Components are made available 
to other threads before ObjectTemplateManager::createObject() are returned.

*) Addition of a Component to an Objects can be done only by 
ObjectTemplateManager::addComponentToObject().

*) Thread safeness. After an Object and its Components are created, to avoid 
deadlock rules are as follow:
	a) a Component method could call its owner Object's methods (so it possibly 
	lock first its mutex and then the Object's one)
	b) no Object method call its Components' methods
	c) no ObjectTemplateManager methods are called by Object or Components' methods
